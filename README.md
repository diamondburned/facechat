# Facechat

A (dead) HackMIT 2020 project.

## Objective

> Goal: messaging app with different chatrooms on different levels of privacy
> so that people can share ideas, and meet new people with similar views (kind
> of like different virtual lounges for them to hang out with since real
> cafes/places people would normally go to meet others with similar opinions
> are dead). They would have 4 levels of privacy as follows: 100% anonymous,
> public chatrooms anyone using the app can enter which would have no name,
> no avatar, semi-private chatrooms where people could see the real life name
> and avatar, timezone, and very private rooms where people would share
> everything: social media accounts, even location, etc. Ideally people would
> meet on the top level of anonymity and then form more private chatrooms once
> they got to know people better, making this the digital version of places
> that people used to go to socialize and make friend groups. To sign onto the
> app people would have a "contract" where they have to link two social
> accounts.
